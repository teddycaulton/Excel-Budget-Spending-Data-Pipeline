this project is meant to demo connection to two excel spreadsheets to grab aggregated data from one sheet and move it over to another sheet where yearly budgets are tracked.  The current use case for this pipeline connects two excel spreadsheets but the api utilized is equally cross compatible with google sheets.  This makes it ideal for moving data between platforms without writing an API manually or utilzing the google sheets API.
